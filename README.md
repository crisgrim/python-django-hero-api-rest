# python-django-hero-api-rest
This is a repository with my first API with Python and Django Rest Framework.

This API allows all the following methods:

- GET - All heroes

- GET - A hero by id

- POST - Create a new hero

- PATCH - Edit a hero (partially)

- PUT - Edit a hero (whole)

- DELETE - A hero by id


This is the [collection](postman/Heroes.postman_collection.json) that I use to test it on Postman.
